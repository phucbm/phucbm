### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Minh-Phuc Bui.

A front-end web developer focused on optimized experience and effective animations.

#### I do open-source projects
It is kind of a hobby to create all of these things.

The Easy Collections: some open-source projects that were created by me and our team. See the [published ones](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aeasy-collection) on GitHub.

More highlighted projects at the pinned section below.
